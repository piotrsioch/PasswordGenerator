# Password Generator

This is program, which allows you to create unique and safe passwords. During front-end codding I followed the look of the website https://passwordsgenerator.net/

-----------------
# Using the application

After launching the application, you will see a window, in which you have to select the password proporties - if it will inlcude symbols, numbers etc. After deciding,
click Generate Password button. The password will appear in textfield. A text will appear under the password to help you remember the password.
You can copy it to your ciplboard by clicking on copy button, or save it on your computer by clicking save button.

If you want to create more than one password, click on 'Generate more than one password'. There will apear new combobox, where you can decide how many password will be
generated. The rest works as in previous version.

Application validates the data. You have to select at least one of the checkboxes to generate the password. If you select no duplicate characters and selected password
length will be greater than chosen characters the password will not be generated.
